    "description": "The INSTAR DDNS Service Three Easy Steps to access your Camera through the Internet The basic concept of remote access In general we have to differentiate between two types of connections. You can access your camera's WebUI over it's internal IP address - which usually starts with 192.168.x.x or 10.0.x.x. This means that the computer as well as the camera are running in the same network and are most likely connected to the same router. You can then connect to the camera using the private IP address of the camera. The other connection is the external access from outside your network. In this case you need to use your camera's DDNS address ta access the WebUI from anywhere in the world. No matter if you are sitting in the train using a smartphone or if you are on holidays using a laptop. To make this possible a few settings are necessary in the camera as well as in your router. This tutorial shows you step by step how to set up the external connection. Ports are numbered connections, which are used by the computer to connect different types of network traffic. Services such as FTP on Port 21 or HTTP on Port 80 are already determined, many operating systems can even choose the right ports for their respective services on their own. For security reasons, all ports to the internet are closed inside your router by default. This is the reason, why you can not access your camera through the internet without forwarding a port. To make this possible, there have to be applied some settings. In the following will be explained how to establish the remote access to your camera step-by-step. I. Static IP Address First of all, connect to your camera in your local network. Then, inside the WebUI, choose Network > IP Configuration (1st Image: 1080P SERIES / 2nd Image 720P SERIES / 3rd Image: VGA SERIES), whereupon the following window appears: IP-Address Here you have to choose an IP-Address for your camera. But be aware, that the IP Address has to relate to your router! Taking the Fritzbox as an example, the beginning of the IP-Address is 192.168.178.XXX by default, for a Telekom Speedport Router it is 192.168.2.XXX. To avoid mistakes in your local network, we recommend to choose the last number higher than 200 (outside of the default DHCP range). If you own a FritzBox, then you take the 192.168.178.201 for your first camera, for your second camera you choose 192.168.178.202, and so on. Subnetmask Enter 255.255.255.0 by default. Gateway In most cases the gateway is the IP Address of your router, for example 192.168.178.1 if you own a FritzBox, or 192.168.2.1 if you own a Telekom Speedport Router. DNS Server In most cases it is your router that handels DNS on your network - just enter the IP Address of your router. HTTP Port Here you have to enter a different port for each of your camera, starting at 8081 ascending. Meaning for camera 1 enter 8081, for camera 2 enter 8082, etc. (In case of a Full HD Camera leave this Port on 80) HTTPS Port This is only for the FullHD-Cameras - Here you have to enter a different port for each of your cameras, starting at 8081 ascending, meaning for camera 1 enter 8081, for camera 2 enter 8082, etc. CLICK HERE if you don't have audio inside our mobile app InstarVision. RTMP Port Here you have to enter a port starting at 1935 ascending. Thus for camera 1 should be set to port 1935, for camera 2 port it´s 1936, etc. This is only important, if you want to access your camera over the internet inside a web browser. You don't need to configure or forward the RTMP/Flash Port in case you only use our smartphone app InstarVision. RTSP Port Here you have to enter a port starting at 554 ascending. Thus for camera 1 it´s port 554, for camera 2 port it´s 555, etc. Only configure and forward this port, if you plan to access your cameras RTSP stream over the internet. The RTSP stream is needed for certain 3rd Party Software - as well as - when you are having difficulties with audio DIFFICULTIES WITH AUDIO with your Full HD Camera. Then click on submit to apply the settings. Now navigate to System > Info (1080P SERIE / 720P SERIE). There you can see the current DDNS-Status. When the status is succesful, your camera registered on our server and you can continue with Step 2, where we will set up your router for the remote access. (Otherwise follow the (red) Troubleshooting below.) II. Forward a Port inside your Router Excursus: Please be reminded, that the first 3 numbers of the IP address define the IP subnet of your LAN (local area network). In our sample we used an AVM Fritz!Box router, which uses the 192.168.178.X subnet, and the Telekom Speedport from T-Mobile, which uses the 192.168.2.X subnet by default. Most other common routers such as TP-Link or others are using the 192.168.1.x subnet. The x can be a number between 1 and 254. Routers, usually, use the number 1. In our sample above, we used 201 as the IP address for the camera. This avoids conflicts induced by the router´s DHCP Server. If the address is too low (for example 100), then there is chance that the same IP is already assigned to a different device - which would lead to an IP address conflict. If you are experiencing troubles accessing the IP address of your camera, you should try changing the IP Address - using our CAMERA TOOL - and see if it works then. After you have set the IP address of the camera, you can then access it - from a computer or phone/tablet inside the same network - in any web browser and the web interface of the camera should open. If you don´t know the IP address of your router, you can check it in the MS-Dos Command window, by typing in ipconfig, this will show you your computer´s and the router´s IP address. Trouble Shooting: If the DDNS Status in your camera is being displayed as Not succesful, reboot your camera and check again, also check the settings applied in step 1. Especially if you receive an Error that there is something wrong with your network configuration Please keep in mind, that it takes a while to register your camera. Also the status might be unsuccessful but accessing your camera is still possible. Also, some routers - especially Telekom Speedports - don't allow you to access your DDNS address from inside your local network. You will have to deactivate WiFi on your phone and try accessing the DDNS address through your phone providers Data network! If after one day you are still unable to connect to your camera via it's DDNS address, it might be possible that your internet connection doesn´t have a public IPv4 Address. In that case you would have to use the P2P FUNCTION for remote access. If the entry of the Domain is missing, please CONTACT OUR SUPPORT so that we can give you a new Domain.",

    "description": "Checking the DDNS address This step is very easy. Please open the web interface of your camera and click on Network - DDNS Service. Here you will find the Manufacturer Domain. This is the address with which you can access your camera over the internet. Remember this address! It normally consist of 4 letters and 2 numbers plus the server domain (e.g. ddns-instar.com). For example if it used the servers xxxxx.ddns-instar.com or xxxxx.ddns-instar.de then the x stands for the 6 letters/numbers. Please make sure that the third party DDNS is set to None. Now please click on System - Info. The DDNS Status has to be displayed as successful. If in some case this DDNS address is missing in your camera please contact the INSTAR Support. If the status is unsuccessful, your camera might have a problem connecting to the internet. You can try restarting the camera and check its IP configuration - especially the DNS Server and Gateway. Please contact the INSTAR support team if the problem persists. You can also check your DDNS address manually with a small program called NSLOOKUP. Open your command prompt (in Windows: go to Start and type in cmd) and type nslookup to start the program. Now type in your DDNS address and wait for the response (see screenshots below). The IP address that is displayed has to be identical with the camera´s WAN IP address. You can check your WAN IP inside your router. Or open the website WIEISTMEINEIP.DE and compare the displayed IPv4 address with the nslookup result. Open your command prompt and type nslookup to start the program. Type in your personal DDNS address and press Enter. The displayed IPv4 address has to be identical with your WAN IP address for the DDNS connection to work. Port Forwarding / Portforwarding / Firewall / NAT- or Port-Rules / Virtual Server In the third and last step we have to tell the router to which IP and which Port he has to connect if you access from the internet in order to access your camera. Therefor your have to set a rule in your router. In most routers this is called port forwarding but some other routers might name it NAT, Firewall or Port rules. Each router also used different expressions for the settings. Our goal is it to make you understand the settings so that you can easily fill out your own routers information for the port forwarding. In our sample we use the AVM Fritz!Box again to show you how to set it. To open the router just use the IP address which we filled in as gateway above and open it in the web browser. You should now see the login screen for your router. In the Fritz!Box you find this settings by clicking Internet - Portfreigabe. Normally all routers need the same following data: Application There are a lot of presets which you can choose from. Such as HTTP Server, Webserver or others. We recommend to make a custom rule each time instead of using a preset rule. Name This is only important if you are using more then one camera so that you can differentiate later between the different cameras. You can name it for example with the camera name or the camera location. Protocol The camera only needs the TCP protocol. You don't need to forward UDP traffic. From (external) Port This is the external (WAN) Port with which you can access the camera later through the internet. If you are only using one camera it is best to set it as 80. If you are using more then one camera you have to increase the port for each camera. So the second camera would use the Port 8081 for example. To (external) Port Some routers might use Port 80 as the Service Port. If so you have to use Port 8081 for the first camera. IP Address Here you have to fill in the IP address from the camera. To (internal) Port This is the internal Port of the camera which we have set up earlier. If you are using a different Port then 80 inside your network then you have to set it here accordingly. We recommend to use Port 80 at this moment. If you want to set up more then one camera you have to make sure that for each camera you will create a port rule in your router. The external Port has to be unique for every camera. We recommend to increase the Port number by one. So first camera is using Port 80 and the second one should use Port 81 and the third camera Port 82 and so on. After you created the Port rule for each camera you should type in the DDNS address + the Port number. For example: http: xxxxx.ddns-instar.com:80 Excursus: To access your camera you can always use the same DDNS address. So if you have more then one camera you only need to remember one address. Most important is that you change the port behind the DDNS number. The reason behind it is that your internet service provider is assigning you a new IP address every 24 hours. Once the address is changed the camera notices this and sents it to the server in order to connect it to our DDNS address. This way you can always access your camera with one address even so the IP behind it changes. So even if you are using different DDNS addresses they all link to one address. So with every address you will access your router. And because of the port forwarding your router then knows to which device you want to be forwarded to. So for example we type the following to access the cameras: Camera 1: http: d2908.ddns-instar.com:80 Camera 2: http: d2908.ddns-instar.com:8081 Camera 3: http: d2908.ddns-instar.com:8082 and so on... Note: If you are using a Fritz!Box or a Netgear Router you can test the connection from within your own network. Most other routers do not support this function. So it is necessary to test it from outside your network. For example from a friends computer or from your computer at work. If you try this with Port 80 and you access your router instead of the camera then you might try to use Port 8081 since it could be that 80 is the service port of your router. If you are using a smartphone App you normally have to fill in the DDNS number instead of the normal IP address and also the Port through which you access the camera. You can also check the user manuals for our WINDOWS PHONE, IOS and ANDROID App.",

    "description": "III. Access your Camera through it´s DDNS Address Please read STEP I on how to configure your camera and STEP II for the necessary router configuration first. In the following we will use the web browser as well as the InstarVision smartphone app to access the INSTAR IP camera remotely. Please open your camera´s Web User Interface and navigate to Network > DDNS (1080P SERIES 720P SERIES). Copy your personal DDNS address into your browser´s address bar amd add your camera´s external port that you forwarded in STEP II - e.g test12.ddns3-instar.de:8081. This address will guide you to your camera´s user interface. Some routers don´t allow you to use your camera´s DDNS address from inside your local network! (e.g. Telekom Speeport) To access your camera you can always use the same DDNS address. So if you have more then one camera you only need to remember one address.

Once the address is changed the camera notices this and updates your DDNS address. This way you can always access your camera with one address - even so the WAN IP behind it changes. All DDNS addresses from cameras inside the same local network all link to one address - the WAN IP that your ISP assigns to your router. So with every address you will reach your router. And because of the port forwarding your router then knows to which device you want to be forwarded to.

Remark: It can take up to half an hour for your DDNS address to activate. If your connection fails, wait for 30min (restart your router as it might have cached the earlier failed attempt) and then try again.

But there are routers such as the Telekom Speedport which will block your request - you are only able to access your camera over it's local IP address (e.g. 192.168.1.201:8081). This means you would have to use a computer in another network, or alternatively test the DDNS Access by using the mobile network on your smartphone. It is not possible to use the DDNS Service if you don´t have a public IPv4 address. If you only have an IPv6-address, you can ask your provider to give you an IPv4-address.

    "description": "Third Party DDNS Addresses - DNS stands for Domain Name System - which is like the telephone directory for the internet. Every website sits behind a number - it´s IP address - and the DNS servers of the internet allow you to connect to them without memorizing them. Whenever you type google.com into your browsers address bar, your computer or smartphone calls out and checks the domain name directories of the internet for the corresponding IP address. An IP address is a unique number that allows computers to locate each other on a network. The Internet is a big network and uses IP addresses to route communication to the proper host. The IP in IP address stands for Internet Protocol. What is this DDNS all about? Why do we hide the real addresses of our websites behind domain names? Firstly, the IP addresses are a bit difficult to memorize for organic brains like ours. And secondly, the IP address of a web site might change over time. The latter is a smaller problem for Google - they pay for the IP addresses and they will keep them for a while - but it is a big problem if you want to use an IP camera at home (or in general a local webserver for that matter). Your router is assigned a WAN IP address (Wide Area Network) by your internet services provider. This is your telephone number that allows you to call home when your are at work. You can check your personal WAN IP by opening a web site like wieistmeineip.de. You can check the IP address of your websites yourself, by typing nslookup into your command prompt and then the web domain you want to check. In this case we found that one of the IP address of google.com is 173.194.127.160. So if checking your WAN IP address is so simple, why not write it down and just use it to connect to your camera? The problem is, that your WAN IP address usually changes every 24hrs. You can usually buy static IP addresses from your provider - but if you don´t want to spend extra money on that, you would have to check your WAN IP address every morning before leaving your house. Having a static domain name that is automatically updated with the newest WAN IP address of your router every time the address changes starts to sound tempting? Why would I want to have a Third Party DDNS Address? That is why we already installed a DDNS address on your INSTAR camera. You can always use this service to connect to your camera from the internet (IF you have a port forwarding set up inside your router!). So why would you want to have a third party DDNS address running to connect to your camera? Every INSTAR camera comes with a preinstalled DDNS address so you don´t have to worry about the things we talk about here. In the INSTAR DDNS address seen above instar01 is your cameras personal host, the ddns3-instar.de is the domain of our DDNS server and the complete address instar01.ddns3-instar.de is called the hostname of your address. For security reasons, the host part installed on your camera is generated randomly and cannot be traced back to your purchase. And the domain name is given by the server your camera is registered to. This means you don´t have any control over your camera´s hostname. We already try to make them as easy to remember as possible - but maybe you just want to have a personalize address? Or being able to access your camera at any time is very important and you are looking for redundancy? That is where third party supplier will come in handy. So just hop to a website like www.noip.com, create a account and install it on your camera? Well yes, that is possible. But the interesting part is that you don´t have to deactivate your INSTAR DDNS address in your camera to use a third party one. You can set it up inside your router, on a webserver that is running all the time anyway or on the surveillance station ( QNAP or Synology) you use with your camera. This way you can have a personalized, and easy to remember, hostname - but still have your INSTAR address as a fall back option. And yes, you heard right! You just need one DDNS address, that is either maintained by your camera or your router, to connect to any device inside your local network. As we discussed earlier, the DDNS hostname is fancy way of writing down your routers WAN IP address. So, even if you have 5 INSTAR cameras running in your network, every single one of those DDNS addresses will just lead you to your router. The router then decides, based on the port the request is coming from, which cameras should be called. So basically, you only have to memorize 1 DDNS address and vary the port to call different cameras: Camera 1: instar01.ddns3-instar.de:8081, Camera 2: instar01.ddns3-instar.de:8082, Camera 3: instar01.ddns3-instar.de:8083. For information on how to forward these ports and why you should choose ports above 8080, please read on in our port forwarding article that will walk you through the setup for a couple of standard internet routers. In the following we will set up 3 different third party DDNS addresses on different systems. You will see that setting up the hostname and using it with an update service on your router or any other system is very easy and the steps are always the same - no matter what provider and hardware you plan to use. We choose those three providers because they offer free hostnames for you to experiment with. No-IP (English), Selfhost (German), DDNSS (German).",

    "description": "Connect to your Camera over the Internet Software ports are numbered connections that a computer uses to sort types of network traffic. A few services, such as FTP on port 21 and HTTP on port 80, are assigned by default to open ports where operating systems can find them easily. When a port is opened, a service, such as a the web user interface of your IP camera, is assigned to it. For security, by default all ports to the Internet and most LAN ports are closed so that traffic cannot flow through them. Which is why you cannot connect to your camera via the internet (DDNS) address. Connect to your Routers Interface Enter your routers IP address into the address bar of a web browser. This will open your router’s configuration page. For most routers, this will be 192.168.0.1, 192.168.1.1, 192.168.2.1 or 192.168.178.1. If you don´t know the exact IP address of your router you can use your command prompt or terminal to determine it. The router’s IP address is usually the same as the Default Gateway - at least in home and small business networks. For Windows: Open the command prompt and enter ipconfig all. For Mac: Open the terminal and enter netstat nr. For Linux: Open the terminal and enter route. The Default Gateway of your home or small business network is most likely the IP address of your router. Access your Router If you've already configured the security settings for your router, enter the username and password you chose then. If not, check the sticker on your router for a device password (this is not the same as the WiFi password!). In case you cannot find a password, try typing in default password + your routers model number into the search engine of your liking - for example GOOGLE. The default password for your router should be among the first few page hits. There are also websites devoted to this problem - you can check PORTFORWARD.COM or ROUTERPASSWORDS.COM for your router model. If you've forgotten your login information, you can press the reset button on your router to reset it to factory defaults. You can then look up the factory default settings online. Type in your router login to access the configuration interface. Access your Router Find the Port Forwarding section - Each router will be slightly different. Common labels are Port Forwarding, Applications, Gaming, Virtual Servers, Freigaben, Spiele und Anwendungen, Portweiterleitung, NAT Firewall. If you don't see one of these or something similar, try Advanced Settings and look for a Port Forwarding subsection. Once you found the section, enter a name for the service - e.g. INSTAR camera. Then choose the service type - This can be TCP, UDP, or both. Your IP camera only needs the TCP protocol. Then select the ports you wish to use. For your camera you have to open it´s web http internal port that you can set in the camera webUI under Network IP Configuration. If you want to access the RTSP stream of an HD camera model you will have to forward the corresponding RTSP port. Now select the IP address of your camera and assign the port forwarding to it. This is the IP address that is displayed by the INSTAR camera tool and that you can see in your browsers address bar when you accessed the camera´s web user interface. How this looks like strongly depends on the router and firmware version you are using. In the following we will discuss the necessary steps for the most common routers in home networks. If your router is not among this selection please read on on portforward.com that has a much larger collection of router example available.",

Fritzbox 7490 & 7390 Open the WebUI of your FritzBox Router by typing fritz.box in your browser, or by alternatively typing its IP-address (by default: 192.168.178.1). Log-in and you will find yourself in the main menu of your FritzBox. In the menu, head to Internet > Freigaben and click on Gerät für Freigaben hinzufügen. (In older WebUI it might be called Neue Portfreigabe) In this new window under Gerät choose your camera. Check if the IP-address is correct and then click on Neue Freigabe in the bottom right. Here you have to apply the settings as follows: By clicking on OK and then Übernehmen, the settings will be saved and the camera is listed in the Port Forwardings. To be able to access the Flash Video as well, there has to be set a second Port Forwarding. Just follow the manual of this step, with the only difference to to set the Flash (RTMP) Port instead. So for your first camera all ports are set to 1935, for your second camera it´s 1936, etc. Now all Port Forwarings for your camera are set in the router. You can now continue with the next step: Trouble Shooting Mobile Accesspoints - 3G LTE Router which use a SIM-card often don´t get a public IPv4 Address which is needed for the DDNS Service. If you use a mobile internet connection on the network of your camera and you´re not able to access it through the internet, you should ask your provider if it is possible to get a WAN IP. Most of the bussiness contracts usually offer this option. A public IP Address is needed to access the camera by using DDNS -> SEE P2P Another problem cause could be a DS-Lite (Dual Stack Lite) connection. It is not possible to access your camera via DDNS if you are using DS-Lite. This is the case if your provider is using IPv6-addresses instead of IPv4-addresses. You can check HERE, if you have an IPv4-address SEE P2P. If you´re using a mobile Accesspoint or IPv6 with your camera, there is only one solution for the remote access. All of our HD-Cameras have a Point-2-Point UserID (P2P UID), which makes remote access possible no matter which internet conection you use with your camera SEE P2P. Another reason why you can´t remotely access your camera via DDNS might be the Kindersicherung (child safety device) of your FritzBox. You can check in the list for the child safety for your camera and grant it unbeschränkt (unlimited) access.",

    "description": "Port Forwarding: Setting up port forwarding in your Telekom Speedport: To access your camera through the internet you will need a portforwarding service inside your router. For more general information about the ddns access please refer to HERE. Telekom Speedport (300, 500 and 700 Series): In your router please click on Netzwerk and then choose NAT & Portregeln. If you have a W500V Speedport router then you have to also choose Neues Gerät hinzufügen at NAT & Portregeln so you add the camera as a new device in the router. Therefor you need to know the MAC address of your IP camera. You can check the cameras MAC address by opening the command line in windows which you find at Start - Programs - Accessories - Command. This will open a small window in Dos Mode. Here you can simply type in arp - a. This will list you all IP addresses that your computer is connected with including the MAC address. Search for your cameras IP and write down the MAC address of the camera. Now please go back in the Speedport router and add the device. All other Speedport routers normally do not need this setting. Go to Netzwerk NAT und Portregeln to set a new port forwarding rule for your camera. Auswahl: Here please do not choose anything. Or you could choose HTTP Server which will use the default web port 80. Bezeichnung: Here please choose a name for the forwarding rule. For example IP Camera or Instar. Gültig für Gerät: Now please choose the device name or the IP address of your IP camera. This should be the same address that you are using in order to open your IP camera in the web browser. Mostly this address should start with 192.168.2.x. Umgeleitete Ports - Öffentlich: Please choose 80 as your port. If you do not want to choose Port 80 you have to make sure that later when you try to access the camera that you also have to type in the Port in the address bar with : for example xxx.ddns-instar.com:87 in case you are using Port 87. Umgeleitete Ports - Private Client: As default you can fill in 80. If you are using InstarVision and you want to do Portforwarding to the integrated web server you also have to fill in 80 if you didnt change the Port inside the software. Telekom Speedport (900 Series): To access the user interface of your router open the following address with your internet browser 192.168.2.1. The default login can be found on a sticker on the back of the router. Navigate to the Portfreischaltung in the Internet tab. Click on Weitere TCP Umleitung anlegen and pick your cameras IP address from the drop-down menu. You can find your cameras IP address using our IP Camera Tool. Type your cameras port - the default port is 80 - into all 3 fields and click Speichern to save the service. Go to Internet Portfreischaltung to set a new port forwarding rule for your camera. Your camera can now be reached via the ddns address that can be found under System Info in your cameras user interface (s. above). In case the port 80 is already taken in your network you will have to change the camera port under Network Basic Network Settings and of course adjust the portforwarding service to the new port. Use your personal internet address under System Info in the cameras web user interface to your camera from the road. Adding More Cameras: If you are using more then one camera you have to also create another Port rule for each camera.Please make sure that the Öffentliche Port is always different for each port forwarding. For example if you are using Port 8081 for the first camera then the second camera should have the Port 8082 and the third camera Port 8083 and so on.
