One connection is the <strong>internal access</strong> which with we access the WebUI of the camera. This means that the computer as well as the camera are running in the same network and are most likely connected to the same router. You can then connect to the camera using the private IP address of the camera. The other connection is the <strong>external access</strong> to open the WebUI of the camera from outside your network. With this connection you can allow the access from anywhere in the world to your camera. No matter if you are sitting in the train using a smartphone or if you are on holidays using a laptop to access. To make this possible a few settings are necessary in the camera as well as in your router. This tutorial shows you step by step how to set up the external connection.</p></div></div></div></div></section><div class="wrap"><div class="container main"> <% include ../_partials/content/_bluenav-general.ejs %><article class="blade wrapper content"><div><h1 class="post-title">Access your IP Camera over the Internet</h1></div><div class="card-container margin"><div class="onecard twelve columns"><amp-youtube data-videoid="FjE95bL7_p4" layout="responsive" width="480" height="270" class="shadow"></amp-youtube></div></div><div class="margin"><h4 class="post-title">Three easy steps to set up the access to your INSTAR IP camera from outside your network via internet</h4></div><div class="margin"><h3>Static IP address</h3><p>Connect to the camera with the private IP address. Once you opened the web interface please click on Network/IP Configuration. The default setting is that the IP gets assigned by DHCP Server which means the router is giving the camera a free IP address every 24 -48 hours. This would have the effect that we have to change all settings again after this time period. In order to make sure the IP address is not changing we have to assign the camera a fixed IP address which doesn't change. Please uncheck the box Obtain IP from DHCP Server and some new fields will appear for our settings. You should see something like this:</p></div><div class="margin"><amp-img on="tap:Port_Forwarding_EN_01" role="button" tabindex="0" src="/images/Internet_Access/Port_Forwarding_EN_01.jpg" width="620" height="206" layout="responsive" class="shadow"></amp-img></div><div class="margin"><table><tr><td width="20%"> <strong>IP Address</strong></td><td>The first three numbers define the IP area of the router and therefore are the same as the routers IP address. Only the last number has to be changed to a unique address. It is important that no other device.</td></tr><tr><td width="20%"> <strong>Subnet Mask</strong></td><td>The default subnet mask for most private networks is 255.255.255.0. You can open the command prompt or MacOSX terminal and type ipconfig /all to check your subnet mask (as well as the default gateway and DNS server - see below).</td></tr><tr><td width="20%"> <strong>Gateway</strong></td><td>Here you have to fill in the IP address of your router. Usually the same as your camera´s IP address but with a <strong>1</strong> (number one) in the final octet - like 192.168.1.<strong>1</strong> .</td></tr><tr><td width="20%"> <strong>DNS Server</strong></td><td>Normally this is always the same as the Gateway. In our sample we used an open DNS server from Google 8.8.8.8.</td></tr><tr><td width="20%"> <strong>HTTP Port</strong></td><td>This is the internal Port (also called LAN Port) of the camera - the default port is 80. If you run into difficulties connecting with your camera over the internet, change this port to a number higher than 8080 (8081, 8082, etc.). Please remember that you also have to adjust this port inside your routers <a href="/Internet_Access/Port_Forwarding">port forwarding</a>.</td></tr></table></div><div class="margin"><p>This data has to be filled in for each camera. Very important is that the IP address is never given twice to a device since otherwise it would cause a IP conflict. It is the easiest if you are using continues IP addresses. For example camera one gets 192.168.178.190 and then camera two should be set to 192.168.178.191 and so on. Also the Port number should be given continues.</p></div><div class="primarycard"><p><strong><u>Excursus:</u></strong><br/><br/>Please notice that the first 3 numbers of the IP address define the IP area of the router. In our sample we have used the AVM Fritz!Box. Another example would be the Telekom Speedport from T-Mobile. This router uses by default the IP area 192.168.2.x. Most other common routers such as TP-Link or others are using the IP area 192.168.1.x. The "x" can mean a number between 1 and 256. All routers normaly are using the number "1". In our sample above we used 190 as the IP address for the camera. This is normaly better since a high number is mostly not used by the routers DHCP Server. If the address is too low (for example 100) then the change that this number is given twice to a device (once by you and once by the DHCP Server) is very high. If you are experiencing troubles accessing the IP address of your camera you might change the IP and try if it is better. After you have set the IP address of the camera you can then access it in any webbrowser and the web interface of the camera should open. Important is that this device where you try to open the web interface from is inside your network. If you dont know the IP address of your router you might check it in the MS-Dos Command windows by typing in "ipconfig". This will show you the computers and the routers IP address just in case you are not sure which IP is the right one.</p></div><div class="margin"><h3>Checking the DDNS address</h3><p>This step is very easy. Please open the web interface of your camera and click on Network - <strong>DDNS Service</strong>. Here you will find the <strong>Manufacturer Domain</strong>. This is the address with which you can access your camera over the internet. Remember this address! It normally consist of 4 letters and 2 numbers plus the server domain (e.g. ddns-instar.com). For example if it used the servers <u>xxxxx.ddns-instar.com</u> or <u>xxxxx.ddns-instar.de</u> then the "x" stands for the 6 letters/numbers. Please make sure that the third party DDNS is set to <em>None</em>. Now please click on <em>System - Info</em>. The DDNS Status has to be displayed as successful.</p></div><div class="margin"><amp-img on="tap:Port_Forwarding_EN_02" role="button" tabindex="0" src="/images/Internet_Access/Port_Forwarding_EN_02.jpg" width="620" height="329" layout="responsive" class="shadow"></amp-img></div><div class="margin"><p>If in some case this DDNS address is missing in your camera please contact the INSTAR Support. If the status is unsuccessful, your camera might have a problem connecting to the internet. You can try restarting the camera and check its IP configuration - especially the DNS Server and Gateway. Please contact the INSTAR support team if the problem persists.</p><p>You can also check your DDNS address manually with a small program called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nslookup">nslookup</a>. Open your command prompt (in Windows: go to Start and type in <strong>cmd</strong>) and type <em>nslookup</em> to start the program. Now type in your DDNS address and wait for the response (see screenshots below). The IP address that is displayed has to be identical with the camera´s WAN IP address. You can check your WAN IP inside your router. Or open the website <a href="http://wieistmeineip.de/">wieistmeineip.de</a> and compare the displayed IPv4 address with the nslookup result.</p></div><div class="margin"><amp-img on="tap:Nslookup_01" role="button" tabindex="0" src="/images/Internet_Access/Nslookup_01.png" width="620" height="313" layout="responsive" class="shadow"></amp-img></div><div class="margin"><p>Open your command prompt and type nslookup to start the program.</p></div><div class="margin"><amp-img on="tap:Nslookup_02" role="button" tabindex="0" src="/images/Internet_Access/Nslookup_02.png" width="620" height="313" layout="responsive" class="shadow"></amp-img></div><div class="margin"><p>Type in your personal DDNS address and press Enter.</p></div><div class="margin"><amp-img on="tap:Nslookup_03" role="button" tabindex="0" src="/images/Internet_Access/Nslookup_03.png" width="620" height="313" layout="responsive" class="shadow"></amp-img></div><div class="margin"><p>The displayed IPv4 address has to be identical with your WAN IP address for the DDNS connection to work.</p></div><div class="margin"><h3>Port Forwarding / Portforwarding / Firewall / NAT- or Port-Rules / Virtual Server</h3><p>In the third and last step we have to tell the router to which IP and which Port he has to connect if you access from the internet in order to access your camera. Therefor your have to set a rule in your router. In most routers this is called port forwarding but some other routers might name it NAT, Firewall or Port rules.</p><p>Each router also used different expressions for the settings. Our goal is it to make you understand the settings so that you can easily fill out your own routers information for the port forwarding. In our sample we use the AVM Fritz!Box again to show you how to set it. To open the router just use the IP address which we filled in as gateway above and open it in the web browser. You should now see the login screen for your router. In the Fritz!Box you find this settings by clicking "Internet" - "Portfreigabe". Normally all routers need the same following data:</p></div><div class="margin"><table><tr><td width="20%"> <strong>Application</strong></td><td>There are a lot of presets which you can choose from. Such as <em>HTTP Server</em>, <em>Webserver</em> or others. We recommend to make a custom rule each time instead of using a preset rule.</td></tr><tr><td width="20%"> <strong>Name</strong></td><td>This is only important if you are using more then one camera so that you can differentiate later between the different cameras. You can name it for example with the camera name or the camera location.</td></tr><tr><td width="20%"> <strong>Protocol</strong></td><td>The camera only needs the <strong>TCP protocol</strong>. You don't need to forward UDP traffic.</td></tr><tr><td width="20%"> <strong>From (external) Port</strong></td><td>This is the external (WAN) Port with which you can access the camera later through the internet. If you are only using one camera it is best to set it as 80. If you are using more then one camera you have to increase the port for each camera. So the second camera would use the Port 8081 for example.</td></tr><tr><td width="20%"> <strong>To (external) Port</strong></td><td>Some routers might use Port 80 as the Service Port. If so you have to use Port 8081 for the first camera.</td></tr><tr><td width="20%"> <strong>IP Address</strong></td><td>Here you have to fill in the IP address from the camera.</td></tr><tr><td width="20%"> <strong>To (internal) Port</strong></td><td>This is the internal Port of the camera which we have set up earlier. If you are using a different Port then 80 inside your network then you have to set it here accordingly. We recommend to use Port 80 at this moment.</td></tr></table></div><div class="margin"><p>If you want to set up more then one camera you have to make sure that for each camera you will create a port rule in your router. The external Port has to be unique for every camera. We recommend to increase the Port number by one. So first camera is using Port 80 and the second one should use Port 81 and the third camera Port 82 and so on. After you created the Port rule for each camera you should type in the DDNS address + the Port number. For example:</p><p><strong>http://xxxxx.ddns-instar.com:80</strong></p></div><div class="primarycard"><p><strong><u>Excursus:</u></strong><br/><br/>To access your camera you can always use the same DDNS address. So if you have more then one camera you only need to remember one address. Most important is that you change the port behind the DDNS number. The reason behind it is that your internet service provider is assigning you a new IP address every 24 hours. Once the address is changed the camera notices this and sents it to the server in order to connect it to our DDNS address. This way you can always access your camera with one address even so the IP behind it changes. So even if you are using different DDNS addresses they all link to one address. So with every address you will access your router. And because of the port forwarding your router then knows to which device you want to be forwarded to. So for example we type the following to access the cameras:</p><p><strong>Camera 1:</strong> http://d2908.ddns-instar.com:80<br/><br/> <strong>Camera 2:</strong> http://d2908.ddns-instar.com:8081<br/><br/> <strong>Camera 3:</strong> http://d2908.ddns-instar.com:8082 and so on...<br/><br/></p></div><div class="margin"><p><u>Note:</u> If you are using a Fritz!Box or a Netgear Router you can test the connection from within your own network. Most other routers do not support this function. So it is necessary to test it from outside your network. For example from a friends computer or from your computer at work. If you try this with Port 80 and you access your router instead of the camera then you might try to use Port 8081 since it could be that 80 is the service port of your router. If you are using a smartphone App you normally have to fill in the DDNS number instead of the normal IP address and also the Port through which you access the camera.
