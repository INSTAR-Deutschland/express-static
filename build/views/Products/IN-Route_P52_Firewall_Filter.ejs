To access the interface, please charge your router, switch it into WiFi mode and connect to it´s WiFi network. For more details please follow the instructions for the <a href="/Products/IN-Route/First_Steps/Login">router login</a>. To follow this article, please make sure that your router´s webUI is switched to the Advanced Mode - the Simple Mode will not contain all the options we are covering here. Please be also aware that what we are doing here can be considered an advanced configuration. In most cases you will be fine just following the <a href="/Products/IN-Route/First_Steps">First Steps Configuration</a> discussed earlier. So, are you up to some advanced routing terminologies and exciting features? Then lets go!</p><br><div><amp-img src="/images/Products/IN-Route_P52_21en.png" width="1000" height="572" layout="responsive" class="shadow"></amp-img></div><p class="justify">Do you want to block a device on the IN-Route Network from accessing the internet?

You can use this function to block a specific client on your network from accessing a certain webserver. The Destination IP Address is the IP address of the server you want to block. You can use the command “nslookup” in your command line tool to resolve the IP address from a web address. The Source MAC and IP Address belong to the wireless client you want to block. For regular web traffic choose the protocol TCP and the web port 80 to block - both as source and destination port. For a blocking rule the Default Packet Rule has to be set to “Accept” and the Action rule to “Drop Packet”. The rule in the example above, on the other hand, would block all traffic from the client 192.168.169.254 except traffic directed to the web server 188.40.105.141 via the ports 33333, 33334, 33335, 33336, 33337, 33338 and 33339.</p></div></div></section></div></div> <% include ../_partials/content/_bluenav-general-mobile.ejs %><footer> <% include ../_partials/amp/_amp-footer.ejs %></footer></body></html>
