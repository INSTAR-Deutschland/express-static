To access the interface, please charge your router, switch it into WiFi mode and connect to it´s WiFi network. For more details please follow the instructions for the <a href="/Products/IN-Route/First_Steps/Login">router login</a>. To follow this article, please make sure that your router´s webUI is switched to the Advanced Mode - the Simple Mode will not contain all the options we are covering here. Please be also aware that what we are doing here can be considered an advanced configuration. In most cases you will be fine just following the <a href="/Products/IN-Route/First_Steps">First Steps Configuration</a> discussed earlier. So, are you up to some advanced routing terminologies and exciting features? Then lets go!</p><br><div><amp-img src="/images/IN-Route_P52_29en.png" width="1000" height="569" layout="responsive" class="shadow"></amp-img></div><p class="justify">The IN-Route will - once connected to the internet - contact the NTP server that is defined here to match it´s internal clock and calendar.</p></div><div class="margin"><p class="justify">The Network Time Protocol is a networking protocol that allows the router to synchronize it´s internal clock with an internet NTP server. Simply choose an NTP server, your time zone and a sync interval to synchronize the time with the NTP server. Keep in mind that the synchronization will only work when your IN-Route is connected to the internet and might take a few minutes to complete.</p></div></div></section></div></div> <% include ../_partials/content/_bluenav-p-mobile.ejs %><footer> <% include ../_partials/amp/_amp-footer.ejs %></footer></body></html>
