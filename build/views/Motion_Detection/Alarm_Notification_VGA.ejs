So that camera takes the last picture and compares it with the new one. This will also have the effect that the camera will notice a change of brightness in the picture in the same way as it notices a person or object moving through the picture. With the sensitivity you can set how many percentage of a picture has to change until the camera will cause an alarm.</p></div></div></div></div></section></div></div><div class="wrap"><div class="container main"> <% include ../_partials/content/_bluenav-md.ejs %><article><div class="margin"><table><tr><td> <a href="/Motion_Detection/Alarm_Notification/1080p_Series/"><button class="btn">1080p Series</button></a></td><td> <a href="/Motion_Detection/Alarm_Notification/720p_Series/"><button class="btn">720p Series</button></a></td><td> <a href="/Motion_Detection/Alarm_Notification/Troubleshooting/"><button class="btn btnRed">Troubleshooting</button></a></td></tr></table></div><div class="margin"><h2>VGA Camera Series</h2><p>Setting up and activating the email alarm.</p><h3>Step 1</h3><p> In order that the camera can sent you pictures by email you have to save your email providers data inside the camera. This can be done if you open the web interface of your IP camera and then click on <strong>Alarm</strong> in order to open the <strong>Email Menu</strong>.<br/><br/> On the right side you now have to fill in the following data:</p><ul><li><strong>Sender</strong>: Please fill in your email address. This can be the same email address as the receiver.</li><li><strong>Receiver 1</strong>: Please fill in the email address that should receive the alarm message.</li><li><strong>SMTP Server</strong>: Here you have to fill in the SMTP Server from your email provider. Mostly you can find this data on the website of your email provider by searching for SMTP. Otherwise you find a list <a href="/Motion_Detection/Alarm_Notification/SMTP_Servers">HERE</a>.</li><li><strong>SMTP Port</strong>: Fill in the Port which your email provider is using. Normally this will be either Port 25, 465 or 587. Transport Layer Security Protocol: You only need this if you are using Gmail as your email provider. Please choose either TLS or STARTTLS depending on which one you are using.</li><li><strong>Need Authentication</strong>: For almost all email servers this has to be activated so that you can identify yourself with your username and password.</li><li><strong>SMTP User</strong>: Please fill in the username of your email account.</li><li><strong>SMTP Password</strong>: Please fill in the password of your email account.</li><li><strong>Report Internet IP by Mail</strong>: This function can normally be deactivated. If you activate this service the camera will sent you always the newest internet IP address. Every 24 hours your ISP changes your IP address so the camera will always sent you the newest one. Since the camera has a integrated DDNS address this function is normally not needed.</li></ul><p>Now please save all settings by clicking <strong>Submit</strong>. After submitting the data to the camera we recommend you to click <strong>Test</strong> in order to see if the data you typed in was right.</p></div><div class="margin"><amp-img on="tap:lightbox5" role="button" tabindex="0" src="/images/Email_Einstellungen_MJPEG_01_EN.jpg" width="700" height="415" layout="responsive" class="shadow"></amp-img><amp-image-lightbox id="lightbox5" layout="nodisplay"></amp-image-lightbox></div><div class="margin"><h3>Step 2</h3><p>After you have now saved all email settings in your camera you still have to activate the email alarm in order to receive an alarm email when a motion is detected. Therefor please click <strong>Alarm</strong> and choose <strong>Alarm</strong> in the sub menu. In the next window please set <strong>Motion Detect Armed</strong> and activate <strong>Send E-Mail on Alarm</strong> as show in the screenshot below.

Depending how many false alarms you will receive you might change the sensibility a little. (1= insensitive and 10= very sensitive) .</p></div></article></div></div> <% include ../_partials/content/_bluenav-md-mobile.ejs %><footer> <% include ../_partials/amp/_amp-footer.ejs %></footer></body></html>
