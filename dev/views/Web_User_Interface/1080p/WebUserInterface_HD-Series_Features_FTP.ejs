                          To use the video <a href="/Web_User_Interface/1080p_Series/Network/FTP/">FTP Upload</a> you first have to set your ftp server address and login credentials. E.g. you can use your <a href="/Motion_Detection/FTP_Server_Setup">routers FTP service</a> as FTP Server - in this case simply put in your routers IP as the FTP Server address. If you set up a FTP server on a local PC (for example with <a href="/Motion_Detection/FTP_Server_Setup">Filezilla Server</a>), use the PC’s local IP address. Of course you can use webservers URL’s as well. The standard FTP port is <strong>21</strong>.

                        <p>To use the video <a href="/Web_User_Interface/1080p_Series/Alarm/Actions/">FTP Upload</a> you first have to set your ftp server address and login credentials. E.g. you can use your routers FTP service as FTP Server - in this case simply put in your routers IP as the FTP Server address. If you set up a FTP server on a local PC (for example with Filezilla Server), use the PC’s local IP address. Of course you can use webservers URL’s as well. The standard <strong>FTP port is 21</strong>.<br/><br/>
                        You can define an upload directory for your camera under FTP Folder. The root folder of the FTP server can be reached by <strong>./</strong>. The separator for the folders is the forward slash. A subfolder (e.g. INSTAR) can be reached by <strong>./INSTAR</strong>. An ending forward slash is not obligatory, but can be used.<br/><br/>
                        The FTP Username and FTP Password are the login credentials for your FTP Account.<br/><br/>
                        The name of the video file is fixed and corresponds to the following syntax: <em>rec011_YYYYMMDDhhmmss.asf</em>. The first part shows the channel that was used for the recording - 11, 12 or 13. Separated by an underscore follows a timestamp, which marks the time of the motion detection.</p>

If your server is installed behind a router with an active network address translation (NAT), or if a firewall is blocking the servers network from an external access by your camera, you should choose the PORT mode.</p>

                        <p>Most modern routers now support USB mass storage devices (USB sticks, hard drives,...) to be plugged in - some even come with a large amount of on-board storage for you to use a Network-Attached-Storage (NAS). This storage spaces can be written on by FTP clients like your INSTAR IP camera. All you need to do is to provide the storage and set up a FTP user inside your router and the camera can send snapshots or even whole alarm video to the server.
